# Business_Intelligence_Experience
I am sharing some of the development snaps which I have developed during my 2.5 years journey as a Business Intelligence Consultant (BI,Informatica) in the MNC company 'Evolutionary Systems Private Limited'

The technical flow for all the procedures like first we got row data from the client, then we did some data transformation using Informatica tool and SQL. After that, we stored that data in the data warehouse and pulled that connection in Oracle Data Repository for data modeling and after that, we made a customized strategy-driven report for clients using Oracle BI tool 

I have been worked for the client SEHA in Abu Dhabi.which had many sub-projects.

In this repository you can find some of my previously developed reports for SEHA.
